400-line budget risk: High

Risks and dependencies:
- Dedicated cloud token pepper must be configured before managed token verification is usable.
- Schema changes must be additive and rollback-safe; do not remove legacy env-token behavior.
- Sync route paths/payloads must remain stable while auth internals change.
- Dashboard sessions must revalidate principal state on every protected request.
- Audit events must never include raw tokens, authorization headers, or cookie values.
- Strict TDD is active: start each slice with failing tests, then implement the smallest passing behavior, then refactor.

## Implementation Tasks

### PR 1 — Storage and auth foundation

- [ ] RED: Add cloudstore migration tests in `internal/cloud/cloudstore/` proving additive creation of `cloud_principals`, `cloud_human_users`, `cloud_principal_tokens`, `cloud_project_grants`, and `cloud_auth_audit_log` without altering existing sync tables.
- [ ] GREEN: Extend `internal/cloud/cloudstore/cloudstore.go` migrations and add focused store methods for principal CRUD, human user create/list/enable/disable, token metadata create/list/revoke, project grant create/list/revoke, admin existence checks, and auth audit insertion.
- [ ] RED: Add `internal/cloud/auth` tests for `Principal`, `PrincipalKind`, roles, token generation format, HMAC verifier behavior, constant-time verification, revoked/disabled rejection, and legacy env principal resolution.
- [ ] GREEN: Implement principal domain types, dedicated token pepper configuration, token generator, token hasher/verifier, and resolver interfaces in `internal/cloud/auth/`.
- [ ] TRIANGULATE: Add error-path tests for duplicate usernames/emails, invalid roles/kinds, duplicate grants, revoked tokens, missing pepper, and hash-only persistence.
- [ ] REFACTOR: Keep storage interfaces small so `internal/cloud/cloudserver` can depend on auth/store contracts without importing dashboard rendering logic.
- [ ] Verify: `go test ./internal/cloud/auth ./internal/cloud/cloudstore` and `go test ./...`.
- [ ] Rollback boundary: revert new migrations and auth foundation only; legacy env-token sync remains untouched.

### PR 2 — Server middleware and sync grant enforcement

- [ ] RED: Add handler tests in `internal/cloud/cloudserver/` proving existing `/sync/*` routes still accept valid legacy tokens and reject invalid/malformed/revoked managed tokens with current auth error style.
- [ ] GREEN: Replace `withAuth` internals in `internal/cloud/cloudserver/cloudserver.go` with principal resolution, request context helpers, and compatibility adapters for existing auth callers.
- [ ] RED: Add push/pull authorization tests for managed principals: granted project succeeds, ungranted project returns `403`, mutation batch with any ungranted project rejects all-or-nothing, mutation pull leaks no ungranted projects.
- [ ] GREEN: Wire principal-aware project authorization through sync chunk and mutation handlers, including `internal/cloud/cloudserver/mutations.go`, while preserving legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` wildcard/list/empty semantics.
- [ ] TRIANGULATE: Add regression tests for legacy sync principal behavior under `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS=*`, explicit lists, normalized projects, and empty/missing allowlist.
- [ ] REFACTOR: Keep sync payload structs and route registration unchanged; auth changes must be internal only.
- [ ] Verify: targeted cloudserver sync tests and `go test ./...`.
- [ ] Rollback boundary: disable managed-token resolver wiring and retain legacy env-token authorization path.

### PR 3 — Bootstrap, admin authorization, and audit-backed admin operations

- [ ] RED: Add admin authorization tests in `internal/cloud/cloudserver/` proving only managed admin principals can create users, issue/revoke tokens, and create/revoke grants; members receive forbidden responses and no state changes.
- [ ] GREEN: Add admin form/API handlers under `internal/cloud/cloudserver/` for human user create/list/enable/disable, token create/list/revoke, and grant create/list/revoke, backed by cloudstore methods.
- [ ] RED: Add dashboard-session tests proving managed admin login succeeds, member admin access fails, disabled/demoted users lose access on the next protected request, and secure cookie attributes are set correctly.
- [ ] GREEN: Update dashboard auth/session handling in `internal/cloud/cloudserver` and `internal/cloud/dashboard` so signed cookies carry principal claims but every protected request revalidates enabled state and role from storage.
- [ ] RED: Add bootstrap tests for legacy dashboard/admin credential creating the first managed admin, rejecting duplicate first-admin bootstrap, and preventing accidental removal of the last usable managed admin path.
- [ ] GREEN: Implement dashboard bootstrap route/handler and last-admin protections, treating `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` as explicit bootstrap/recovery access after managed admins exist.
- [ ] RED: Add audit tests for token create/revoke, user create/enable/disable, grant create/revoke, admin login, dashboard bootstrap, accepted/rejected legacy recovery actions, and redaction of raw tokens.
- [ ] GREEN: Emit synchronous `cloud_auth_audit_log` events for admin/security mutations; fail authoritative admin mutations if audit insertion fails.
- [ ] Verify: targeted admin/dashboard/bootstrap tests and `go test ./...`.
- [ ] Rollback boundary: remove admin/bootstrap routes while retaining storage/auth foundation and legacy auth behavior.

### PR 4 — Dashboard managed-user UX

- [ ] RED: Add dashboard rendering/handler tests for `/dashboard/admin/users`, `/dashboard/admin/users/list`, token partials, grant partials, and contributor/managed-user separation.
- [ ] GREEN: Update `internal/cloud/dashboard/dashboard.go` and related templ/templates/assets to show `Managed Users` separately from contributor analytics.
- [ ] GREEN: Add server-rendered forms and HTMX-compatible partials for user create, enable/disable, token create/show-once, token revoke, grant create, and grant revoke.
- [ ] TRIANGULATE: Test non-HTMX form POST/redirect behavior and HTMX partial responses; partials must be meaningful HTML without hidden client-side policy logic.
- [ ] TRIANGULATE: Test empty states explaining deny-by-default project grants and token show-once warnings.
- [ ] REFACTOR: Keep policy checks in server/auth/store layers; dashboard code must render outcomes, not make authorization decisions.
- [ ] Verify: dashboard package tests plus `go test ./...`.
- [ ] Rollback boundary: remove dashboard UI routes/templates without affecting already-tested admin handlers.

### PR 5 — CLI bootstrap, docs, and final hardening

- [ ] RED: Add CLI tests in `cmd/engram/` for `engram cloud bootstrap admin --username ...`, duplicate bootstrap refusal, optional token issuance printed once, optional project grants, invalid input, and audit event creation.
- [ ] GREEN: Implement `engram cloud bootstrap admin` in `cmd/engram/cloud.go`, using cloud runtime DB configuration by default and an existing DSN override convention only if already present.
- [ ] TRIANGULATE: Test that raw managed tokens are never persisted, logged, audited, rendered in token metadata lists, or printed except the creation/bootstrap response.
- [ ] GREEN: Update docs discovery targets affected by cloud setup and sync auth, starting with `README.md`, `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and any cloud deployment docs found by `rg "ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN|ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN|ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS|cloud bootstrap"`.
- [ ] GREEN: Document managed users/tokens, dedicated token pepper, first-admin dashboard bootstrap, CLI bootstrap, project grants, deny-by-default managed principals, legacy env-token migration, and rollback to legacy sync credentials.
- [ ] RED: Add regression tests that `/sync/*` route methods, paths, request schemas, and response schemas remain unchanged for existing clients.
- [ ] GREEN: Fix any contract drift found by regression tests without changing MVP payloads.
- [ ] REFACTOR: Run `gofmt` on touched Go files and remove any temporary test seams not needed by production behavior.
- [ ] Verify: `go test ./...`, targeted cloud tests (`go test ./internal/cloud/... ./cmd/engram`), and `go test -cover ./...`.
- [ ] Rollback boundary: revert CLI/docs/audit hardening slice while keeping prior reviewed server behavior intact.

## Cross-Slice Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Managed human users are distinct from contributor analytics.
- [ ] Managed tokens authenticate principals; authorization uses principal role and project grants.
- [ ] Token hashes use a dedicated cloud token pepper, not the dashboard/session signing secret.
- [ ] Raw token values are shown once and never stored or audited.
- [ ] Disabled users, revoked tokens, and revoked grants stop future access immediately.
- [ ] Legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`, `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN`, and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` behavior remains compatible during migration.
- [ ] Managed principals are deny-by-default for project sync.
- [ ] Dashboard cookies are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` or stronger, and `Secure` under HTTPS/production rules.
- [ ] CLI and dashboard can create the first managed admin safely.
- [ ] Audit events cover all required MVP identity/security actions without secret leakage.
- [ ] Documentation matches real routes, commands, environment variables, and rollback behavior.
